This piece of music is titled "Hazy"

This piece uses a main 4 chord progression through some unique cords that fit well with the c major pentatonic scale. 
Due to this relationship, the main synth line is matched up with some calm and simple drums before the c major pentatonic scale and 
A minor 11 scales are used to improvise. There is a reverby and echoey melody I used twice to resemble falling leaves or twinkly stars that appears twice throughout the piece. The scale work and improv over these scales happens inbetween the sandwich of the peacful melody. Finally the song begins and ends with a longer section of the main synth chords to ease the listener in and out of the song. 

I used some live loops in my code, but they were just the main synth loop and the drum loops. Once all of them were introduced they did not turn off for the rest of the song, so it was quite simple. 

Overall, I think the music piece managed to capture most of the motif I envisioned. I found the generated sounds to be more pleasant, and the transitions to be manageable and fairly smooth. I found myself able to relax to the music and enjoy an overall pleasant and hazy feeling. Hopefully you can enjoy it too!
